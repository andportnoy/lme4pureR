Description: The penalized least squares (PLS) and penalized iteratively
    reweighted least squares (PIRLS) algorithms from lme4, but written entirely
    in pure R. The purpose is to clarify how PLS and PIRLS work without having
    to read through C++ code, and as a sandbox for trying out modified versions
    of PLS and PIRLS.
